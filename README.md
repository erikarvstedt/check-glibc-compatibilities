[`changes-8e18c70.json`](changes-8e18c70.json) contains all glibc derivations of the last 10 minor glibc releases available in nixpkgs since rev `8e18c70`.
(This file can be generated by `nix run`, which calls [`get-revisions.rb`](./get-revisions.rb))

Run [`./check-compatibilities.sh`](./check-compatibilities.sh) to check various combinations of NSS modules and client binaries with differing glibc derivations.\
This shows that NSS modules and client binaries of all patchlevels of a minor glibc release (e.g. `2.33`) are compatible with each other.
